<h2 id="tools">Interface Tools</h2>

<p>Git is a true UNIX tool in the sense that it consists of many commands
that do one thing well. It has been designed from the start to be easily
wrapped in other tools and frontends. Currently, there are several
interfaces offering more comfortable Git usage, and also graphical
interfaces for browsing the history and more.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the low-level part of Git is called <em>plumbing</em>
and the interfaces and frontends are called <em>porcelains</em>.
Git itself comes with a default porcelain bundled and that is actually
what you will normally mean when you say you use Git. However, there
are several alternative porcelains which might offer considerably more
user friendly interface or extend Git to perform some specialized tasks.</p>

<p>Below, the most widely used tools are listed. Please refer to
<a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/articles/i/n/t/Interfaces,_frontends,_and_tools.html">the corresponding wiki page</a>
for a full list.</p>
