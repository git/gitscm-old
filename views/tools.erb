<h2 id="tools">Interface Tools</h2>

<p>Git is a true UNIX tool in the sense that it consists of many commands
that do one thing well. It has been designed from the start to be easily
wrapped in other tools and frontends. Currently, there are several
interfaces offering more comfortable Git usage, and also graphical
interfaces for browsing the history and more.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the low-level part of Git is called <em>plumbing</em>
and the interfaces and frontends are called <em>porcelains</em>.
Git itself comes with a default porcelain bundled and that is actually
what you will normally mean when you say you use Git. However, there
are several alternative porcelains which might offer considerably more
user friendly interface or extend Git to perform some specialized tasks.</p>

<p>Below, the most widely used tools are listed. Please refer to
<a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/articles/i/n/t/Interfaces,_frontends,_and_tools.html">the corresponding wiki page</a>
for a full list.</p>

  <dt id="gitslave">Gitslave</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://gitslave.sf.net">Gitslave</a>
   is useful to add subsidiary git repositories to a git
   superproject when you control and develop on the subprojects at
   more of less the same time as the superproject, and furthermore
   when you typically want to tag, branch, push, pull, etc all
   repositories at the same time.  It is an alternative to
   git-submodule and the git subtree merge strategy.
