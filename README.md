## The Git Website ##

This is the source for the main Git website, found at git-scm.com.

## Running It ##

This is a Sinatra app, so if you want to run this locally, you can simply run:

    $ rackup config.ru

That should get it running locally so you can test it.  The site is deployed to Heroku.

## Contributing ##

Fork this project, make a change, push to a named branch on GitHub and send me a pull request.
